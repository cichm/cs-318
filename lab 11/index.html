<article>The Galloping Goose was established in 1873 by my great-grandmother, Marike. She
    inherited from her father a 23 acre apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude at the
    age of 16. In the beginning she would sell cider and pies on the edge of town to the
    villagers. Eventually she saved enough turn the farmhouse at the end of her land into
    The Galloping Goose. Over the last century The Galloping Goose has been handed
    down to the eldest daughter who keeps the legacy of the pub alive.
